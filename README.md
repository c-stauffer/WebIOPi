# WebIOPiClient - .NET bindings for WebIOPi API

This project aims to make connecting to devices running [WebIOPi](https://webiopi.trouch.com/) a bit easier from the .NET ecosystem.

<br>

## Getting Started

A NuGet package is [now available](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebIOPiClient), but continuous integration/deployment is not yet implemented so it may be out of date. If you have Visual Studio 2017, you can build the project yourself.

### Prerequisites

The library is built against .NET Standard 2.0 (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) and [here](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md) for more information).

<br>

## Deployment

Check out the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebIOPiClient).

<br>

## Contributing

Any and all pull requests are welcome. This library is currently in its infancy so any contribution is much appreciated.

<br>

## Versioning
